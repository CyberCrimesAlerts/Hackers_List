Unfortunately we were hacked. Today we managed to contact Telegram support and obtain data from the hackers who participated in hacking our employeeâ€™s wallet and social networks. 
The data was transferred to the Interpol department at 18 Napier Rd, Singapore 258510. 

Also today one of the hackers contacted us and warned about a botnet attack on our telegram channel. 
We hope that the stolen funds will be returned to our employee and the hackers will be held accountable to the law for everything.
